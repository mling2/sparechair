# Description
We created a platform for sustainably buying, renting, and selling furniture and any general household items. Our product streamlines the entire selling/renting process and encourages more users to recycle their furniture, while also making it easier for users to get access to used furniture, thus promoting sustainability â€“ our main focus. Sellers fill out a form regarding the condition of their items and provide photos. Users can browse for items or filter by product condition and other properties. Interested renters can block out specific periods of time and confirm so the listing is no longer shown to other users looking to rent that same piece of furniture. This confirmation would be binding where if the person interested in renting out the furniture reneged on this contract, they would be charged a cancellation fee. Currently, we aim to target college students looking to furnish their residences. In the future, we would also focus on anyone looking for temporary furnishing.
